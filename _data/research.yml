- title: Procedural & Inverse Procedural Modeling
  description: A procedural model is a model represented by a code - for example, C++, Python, L-system, or a shape grammar. The objective of inverse procedural modeling is to find a code that would represent a given structure. We have presented several results in the generation of inverse procedural models for regular structures that are represented as L-systems. These 3D models of biological trees were encoded as parameters of a simulation system that generates them. We have also presented a successful application of IPM in cities and complex urban layouts. Another interesting problem is using inverse procedural models learned from existing structures in artistic design, such as interactive "brushing" of virtual worlds.

- title: Simulation of Natural Phenomena
  description: One of the long open problems in Computer Graphics is the visual simulation of Nature. Although the output of those simulations is 3D geometric models, an in-depth understanding of the underlying processes is usually necessary. We have a long history of simulating virtual erosion that generates visually plausible terrains. We have developed several models for river generations and terrain modeling in general. Another exciting area is a simulation of vegetation. Trees and plants are complex systems with a shape defined by competition for resources, among which light is the most important one. By incorporating competition for light into the tree developmental process (growth), we can simulate very complex tree shapes as well as ecosystems of trees competing for resources. We have also presented models of trees growing under the influence of wind.

- title: "Superimages: Image Generalization through Camera Model Design"
  description: We propose an image generalization that removes the uniform sampling rate and single viewpoint constraints of conventional images to increase their information bandwidth. The image generalization is implemented through camera model design, a novel computer graphics paradigm that replaces the conventional linear rays with curved rays, which are routed to sample a 3D dataset comprehensively, continuously, and non-redundantly. The image generalization has benefits in a variety of contexts, including in parallel, focus+context, and remote visualization; in virtual, augmented, and diminished reality; and in the acceleration of higher-order rendering effects.

- title: Augmented Reality Surgical Telementoring
  description: Current surgical telementoring systems require a trainee surgeon to shift focus frequently between the operating field and a nearby monitor that shows a video fo the operating field annotated by a remote mentor. These focus shifts can lead to surgical care delays and errors. We propose a novel approach to surgical telementoring that avoids focus shifts using an augmented reality (AR) interface that integrates the annotations directly into the trainee’s view of the surgical field.

- title: Computer Animation Instructor Avatars for Research on Non-Verbal Communication in Education
  description: Almost a century ago, Edward Sapir noted that we “respond to gestures with an extreme alertness” according to “an elaborate and secret code that is written nowhere, known to none, and understood by all”. Together with psychology researchers we work to break the code of effective instructor gestures in education. We are developing a system of computer animation instructor avatars to research instructor gesture effectiveness in the context of mathematics learning. We examine both gestures that help convey the mathematical concepts as well as gestures that might convey an appealing and engaging instructor personality.
