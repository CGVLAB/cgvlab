  title: Advanced Computer Graphics
  description: CS 434 is a redesigned course of contemporary algorithms in Computer Graphics. The course introduces GPU programming using shaders and CUDA to develop fast and efficient real-time applications. We will closely examine light interaction on surfaces and materials, its formal description by the rendering equation, and its numerical solutions using Monte Carlo path tracing and photon maps. Complex materials that require subsurface scattering will also be discussed. We will follow the latest approaches to shape modeling ranging from subdivision surfaces to procedural models using grammars. The course will show applications of Computer Graphics in additive manufacturing (3D printing). Complex structures used in natural phenomena simulation, particularly L-systems, split grammars, stochastic processes for geometry generation, fractional Brownian surfaces, and other stochastic fractals, will be discussed. Physics-based algorithms will be introduced that couple GPU with numerical solvers for fluid and cloth simulations. The course will also discuss geometric modeling using deep learning applications, particularly generative adversarial networks.
